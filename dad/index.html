            <h2>In Loving Memory of Nitesh Anand</h2>
            <p>November 4, 2022</p>
            <p>My dad was a brilliant programmer who worked at Dell. He had a passion for tinkering with things, understanding how they worked, and using his skills for good. He loved reverse engineering, and he was always learning something new.</p>
            <p>He was a loving husband and father to me and my 8-year-old brother, Atharv. He was also the proud owner of our dog, Maggie.</p>
            <p>This website, and my work on NiteshOS, is a tribute to him and his legacy.</p>
